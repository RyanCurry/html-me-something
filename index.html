				Every year my family attends Audiofeed music festival in Champaigne, Illinois.
				It is held on the Champaigne county fairgrounds.
				The festival is four days long, and we camp with our trailer.
				My brother-in-law and two of my sisters, currently living in Nashville, are in a band that plays on some of the stages.
				It is a family reunion of sorts because there are eleven of us that camp together.

				There are a few hundred of bands that play at the festival, and many of the stages have music from 8:00 am to midnight.

				The festival has been going on for the past four years and every year we see some of the same people and some new faces too.
